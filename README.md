# DCBM

DCBM (Dynamic Continuous Biosensing Monitor) is a portable biosensing platform designed for automated electrochemical measurements and wireless data acquisition.

This repository contains the complete firmware and software stack used for automated electrochemical measurements, wireless communication, and mobile data visualization.


The system consists of:

- Android application for user control and data visualization
- BLE bridge firmware running on STM32-H2-MINI
- PIC-based electrochemical control unit
- LMP91000 analog front-end
- Multiplexer (MUX) controlled electrode selection

The platform enables automated monitoring, data collection, and wireless communication between electrochemical sensors and a mobile device.

## Scientific Background

This platform was developed as part of the work described in:

**Keren Zhou, Minwoo Kim, Chia-Wei Liu, Jack W. Harbell, Amit K. Mathur, Rafael Nunez Nateras, Vadim Jucaud, Mehmet R. Dokmeci, Xiling Shen, Bashar A. Aqel, Joseph Wang, Michelle C. Nguyen, and Yangzhi Zhu**

**A Clinically Deployed Dual-Compartment Biochemical Monitoring Platform for Human Liver Perfusion**

The system enables real-time biochemical monitoring of both perfusate and bile compartments during normothermic machine perfusion of human donor livers, providing continuous physiological information that may assist in organ assessment and transplantation research.

## Project Components

### 1. SmartOrganApp

Android application responsible for:

- Connecting to the device through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- Sending measurement commands
- Receiving sensor data
- Visualizing measurement results
- Logging experimental data

---

### 2. BLE_PIC_Bridge

Firmware running on STM32-H2-MINI.

Responsibilities:
